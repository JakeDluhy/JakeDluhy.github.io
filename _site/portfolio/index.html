            Working for Spiceworks, I was the sole frontend developer for the updated feed. We use the Ember framework, with a JSON API supported backend. I also ran weekly sprints to coordinate upcoming work from the backend architecture, frontend interface, and design. We released our first alpha version within 3 months, and by incorporating user feedback we were able to iterate on design and performance over the next four months. The backend for the feed utilizes the Cassandra database, and operates as a service to our main application. Although I didn't directly work on it, I have been able to gain a solid understanding of the costs and benefits of a service oriented architecture.

            Corvae is a startup created with the goal of helping those at risk of heart disease. My friend Raj, one of the original founders, brought me on to write software to support the wireless ECG monitor that he was creating. I created a backend API server using Ruby on Rails, and a frontend web interface using Ember.js. The webserver is hosted on AWS, and the Ember frontend is deployed using a modified lightning deploy technique. While working on Corvae, I also spent a lot of time working on product decisions, creating preliminary financial projections, and figuring out potential marketing channels. It was an amazing opportunity to learn new skills and utilize my talents in new ways.
          </p>
          <p class="project-description">
            The major features of the web application are the ability to generate a mock ECG data stream, and then simultaneously read it out on another screen. I created this feature for demonstration purposes, because the hardware and mobile app weren't properly transmitting data at the time.

            My senior year of school, I was taking a class in Mathematical Graphics along with my Aerospace classes. In my Dynamics and Controls class, the teacher had created a simulation environment in Matlab to test out the software we wrote for the class. For my Graphics class, I wanted to recreate this type of environment in the browser, with the goal of creating a short tutorial on how Quadrotor controls actually work. I used THREE.js for the graphics, and wrote the quadrotor equations of motion using javascript.

            HigherEd is a project I worked on all throughout my senior year of school. The original idea was to create a startup that would help teachers create digitally integrated lessons. I had noticed through my years as a tutor that students would generally learn better with visual aids, and so the idea was to have lessons that would teach a concept, and then show a visual demo. After talking with teachers and students and receiving feedback, I decided to focus on creating an application that would take virtual graphical visuals and then create .stl files that could then be 3D printed. My short term goal was to create a bridge building application, that would allow students to virtually design a bridge, simulate weighted loads on it, and then 3D print it and test it in the real world. Unfortunately, I ran out of time before I was able to get the simulation working, but I was able to create a rough application to allow someone to design and print out a bridge.

            Spiceworks Chimera is an internal tool that is my current project. It is an A/B split testing internal service, with the goal of combining the efficiency and speed of the ruby split gem with the ease of use and quick deployment of Optimizely. We are building it using Docker with Ruby on Rails to create a fully containerized application. It is a nice change of pace from working on the feed, as I get to dive into the backend, and really work on squeezing out performance out of our service.

            The Aerospace senior design capstone is a year long class that takes you from the mission objectives through concept, development, multiple design reviews, and ultimately to a final presentation/paper. This is usually part of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics' design competition. The competition for our year was to create an Orbital Transfer Vehicle capable of transporting 50,000 lbs from Low Earth Orbit to Earth-Moon Lagrange Points 1 and 2 and 15,000 lbs back. Each transfer had to be within 6 days, and the vehicle had to be reusable for at least 10 missions.
          </p>
          <p class="project-description">
            I was the Power and Thermal Engineer, so my responsibilities included keeping the spacecraft powered at all times, and the internal electronics at the correct temperatures. I picked solar arrays and batteries and sized them appropriately, designed a main bus loosely based off of the space station and other similarly sized spacecraft, ran thermal simulations to determine the correct application of reflective and absorptive materials, all while coordinating with 6 other engineers to ensure that the vehicle integrated each section seamlessly. As a result, our team placed first in the AIAA competition, winning the national award, and I had the opportunity to present our design at the annual AIAA conference.

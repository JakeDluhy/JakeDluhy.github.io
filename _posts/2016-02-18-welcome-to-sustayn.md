Really, I'm not quite ready to launch this site and start talking about everything we're gearing up to do with Sustayn. At this point the app isn't written, I haven't talked to nearly enough people about it, and life is plenty difficult without adding the additional stress of trying to start a startup.

<br>
**But I'm so excited about this.** I haven't felt this strongly about an idea, or obsessed about it this much, since I first started thinking about starting a company nearly 4 years ago. And so I jumped the gun a little bit. I made a logo, I made a site, I got some social media accounts. Everything we need to have in order to tell the world about food waste, and start getting *everyone* excited about solving this problem.

<br>
So this means that if you find this site, and you find this post, and you don't see anything else, be patient. Sign up for the mailing list, start connecting with us, and talk to us. Show us some love. We're coming. And when we do, it's going to be awesome!

<br>
And in the meantime, definitely go and watch the documentary [Dive!](http://www.divethefilm.com/default.aspx) and read [American Wasteland](http://www.wastedfood.com/) (and check out Jonathan Bloom's blog). Happy learning!

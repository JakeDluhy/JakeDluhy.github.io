      That's it! Using the cost function to choose the optimal Q's and R's is the last step to implementing control. Now it's time to test your skills as a controls engineer! In this game, there will be 10 targets placed throughout the space. The object of your quadrotor is to reach each target and hover inside of it for 3 seconds. Once it has done this, that target will disappear, and the quadrotor can move on to the next target. Everything will be timed, so you can repeatedly change the control of your quadrotor to beat the best time!
